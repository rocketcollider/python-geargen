# Gears From Scratch
A simple script turned project to generate profiles for simple meshing gears. Supports involute and cycloidal gears. This was developed over many distinct development cycles in the 2010s, last major patch in 2018.

## Motivation
Basically to understand how gears work and implementing them in some side projects. It was started by a conical planetary gear, continued in a 3D-printable compressor and then just some interface-optimisations.

## Usage
I solemnly recommend you just run the script! The help displayed should be extremely ... helpful.

If you want a preview, you need to install Tkinter. Otherwise no dependencies are required.
